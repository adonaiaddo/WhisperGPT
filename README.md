# WhisperGPT
WhisperGPT is a personal assistant created using Whisper, GPT, and gradio APIs
It employs the stated APIs accordingly:
- Gradio: Creates the user interface and allows us to take in audio and return text to the user
- Whisper: Transcribes the audio input (converts audio to text)
- GPT: Takes the text from whisper as user input and produces a result using the provided system input and specified GPT model
The entire conversation is kept and delivered to the user chronologically (with the most recent response at the bottom)
